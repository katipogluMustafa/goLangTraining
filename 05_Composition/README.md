## Grouping Types

* Go is about convention over configuration.
* Go says configuration is limiting.
* Who is about not who we are,but go is about what we do.
* If we group things together by what we do,not by who we are, then we have a level of diversity.
* Go is very much about let's not limit ourselves on configuration but let's focus what we do.
---
* We only want types where we need values of that type.

 Notes:

 * Declare types that represent something new or unique.
 * Validate that a value of any type is created or used on its own.
 * Embed types to reuse existing behaviors you need to satisfy.
 * Question types that are an alias or abstraction for an existing type.
 * Question types whose sole purpose is to share common state.
