* Start from concrete data then move up this way.
 
 ![Figure 1](img/theWayToSolveProblems.png?)

* Functions should be your first choice until they are not reasonable or practical to do so.

* We must be consistent with semantics.Data drives the semantic.So once the semantic is chosen either everything is value or everything is pointer.And the method and the code you write has to respect the semantic for the data.

* When naming receivers , you want that receiver name to be short , and sweet :P 
    * Receiver name should never be more than three letters long.

* When it comes to calling a method, go only cares that the data is of type.It doesn't care that value or pointer of that data.It all cares we are working with that type.
